JAVA8 didn’t comes with any ready make file copy function, you have to manual create the file copy process. To copy file, just convert the file into a bytes stream with FileInputStream and write the bytes into another file with FileOutputStream.The overall processes are quite simple, just do not understand why JAVA8 doesn’t include this method into the java.io.File class.
